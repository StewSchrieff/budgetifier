# Budgetifier

This repo supports the backend of our project.

`data.csv` is to be used as the 
source of transaction data. This can be a
bank statement csv, or in our case,
a credit card statement from the last
calendar month

# TODO:
- requirements.txt
- build flask backend that serves up array of transactions
- build frontend that supports filtering through transactions
